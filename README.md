SelBlocks Global
=========

[SelBlocks Global](https://selite.github.io/SelBlocksGlobal) is an enhancement of [SelBlocks](https://github.com/refactoror/SelBlocks/). It's a part of [SeLite](https://selite.github.io/). However, SelBlocks Global's code is in a repository separate from [the rest of SeLite](https://github.com/SeLite/SeLite).

See extensive [documentation of SeLite](http://selite.github.io/) for benefits and installation.

GIT-clone and develop on Linux or Mac OS, as this needs symlinks. It requires SeLite to be cloned under that exact name (in CamelCase) in a neighbour directory.
